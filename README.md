This script is used, primarily, to create an archival master and access copy of an XDCam disc where the audio and video tracks are stored as separate MXF files. It concatenates the video track with 2-4 audio tracks into a temporary MXF file, creates a FFV1 MKV master and H264 MP4 access copy from that temp file, deletes the temp file, moves the original data into an originals directory (the master and access files output to master and access directories), and then bags everything according to the [Library of Congress BAGIT standard](https://blogs.loc.gov/thesignal/2019/04/bagit-at-the-library-of-congress/). This was developed for a particular context within my library and may not be applicable to other contexts and is provided as is without warranty.

If you are working in a non-profit and/or cultural heritage context and would like to see further development, or would like an executable of this script, you can [contact me separately](https://utm.library.utoronto.ca/contact/magnus-berg).
